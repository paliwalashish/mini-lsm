# mini-lsm

I came across this wonderful tutorial about [Mini-LSM](https://skyzh.github.io/mini-lsm/00-preface.html) - Build a simple Key-value storage in one week.
With the curosity to learn more about LSM, this was right opportunity to get started. 
The project is implemented in Rust. Rust is on my learning list, however to move a bit faster decided to give it a shot in Java.

The repository shall host the code as I understand better. Also want to experiment with Claude Code to understand things better and not use it to write code.

Goals
- Create LSM storage
